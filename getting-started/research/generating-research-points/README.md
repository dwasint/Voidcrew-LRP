# Generating Research Points

There are a few ways to generate reserach points. The first is by using a Survey Handheld. You can get a Survey Handheld from an autolathe as shown in the image below.![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (12).png>)

To use a Survey Handheld simply stand still and use it in your hand, and aslong as there isn't anyone else using one and you havent exhausted the research for your node you will start generating research papers. To use the research papers simply click on a linked R\&D console with the paper in hand as shown below

To link the R\&D console aswell as other machines that require linking to the server simply click on the Server with a multitool to add it to the multitools buffer, from there click on the machines that need to be linked and volia you have now linked the machine to the server.

If you need to build the Console and Server you can print the required circuitboard and parts from the autolathe.
