# Generating Research Points

### Surveying

In order to get research points from surveying you will need a Survey Handheld or any of its more advanced versions.

You can get a Survey Handheld from an autolathe as shown in the image below.

To use a Survey Handheld or any of the more advanced versions simply stand still and use it in your hand, and as long as there isn't anyone else using one and you haven't exhausted the research for your node you will start generating research papers. To use the research papers simply click on a linked R\&D console with the paper in hand as shown below.

To link the R\&D console as well as other machines that require linking to the server simply click on the Server with a multitool to add it to the multitools buffer, from there click on the machines that need to be linked and voila you have now linked the machine to the server.

If you need to build the Console and Server you can print the required circuit-board and parts from the autolathe.

## Dissection

Dissection can be done using surgery tools, the basic dissection doesn't require an operating computer or operating table but if you wish to do the more lucrative versions you will need an operating table and computer linked to your R\&D Server with the required research unlocked. The target also has the be dead in order to dissect them

In order to dissect you will need a Scalpel, Retractor, Hemostat and a Searing Tool . The order is as followed

1. Start the procedure by using any medical tool on them
2. Make an Incision (Scalpel)
3. Retract the skin (Retractor)
4. Clamp the Bleeding (Hemostat)
5. Dissect the target (Scalpel)
6. Clamp the Bleeding (Hemostat)
7. Mend Incision (Searing Tool)

Note: the last 2 steps are only required if you plan to re-dissect the body when you get the more advanced version of dissection. Speaking of which, every-time you upgrade your dissection you can re-dissect your previous targets.

The payouts for dissections are as followed:\
Humanoids: 1500 base points\
Creatures(Goliaths,Watchers,etc): 900 base points\
Advanced Creatures(Xeno,Golems,etc): 4500 base points

These payouts are increased based on the level of dissection performed. The multipliers are as followed:

* Dissection: 1x
* Thorough Dissection: 2x
* Experimental Dissection: 5x
* Extraterrestrial Dissection: 7x
