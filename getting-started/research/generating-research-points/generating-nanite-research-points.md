# Generating Nanite Research Points

Generating Nanite points is much the same as it is on other servers with the small requirement of linking the Nanite's to your server. To do so simply use a Multitool that has an R\&D server in its buffer on the Nanite machines such as program hub, public chamber, chamber. From there you will start to see your nanite research going up aslong as you have nanites in you.
