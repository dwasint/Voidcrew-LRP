# Cloning the Repo so you can Map

Step 1) Download Git.

{% embed url="https://git-scm.com/downloads" %}

Step 2) Get your git clone link from github. To do that go back to the repo you've cloned and click the Code button. From there copy the link you see and there you go!

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (42).png>)

Step 3) From the folder you want to clone to open command prompt by replacing the search bar with cmd.

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (34).png>)

Once CMD is open type git clone then paste your url. So in my case it would be

```
git clone https://github.com/dwasint/Voidcrew-LRP.git   
```

From there you want to switch to the branch you created to do so run git checkout then the name of your branch so in my case

```
git checkout patch-1
```

From there check to make sure your on the right branch with git branch and your branch should be green

## Great! Now that you have your branch we can get into StrongDMM
