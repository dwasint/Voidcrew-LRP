# StrongDMM Tips

Tip 1) DISABLE THE AREA LAYER, for the love of god please do this it will make looking at stuff so much easier. To do this press control and 1 at the same time or click options and make sure Toggle Area isn't checked.

Tip 2) Control Click and Shift Click. Control clicking is the quick key for deleting tiles and objects and shift clicking is the quick key for selecting an object as your active object nice if you want to snag something from another map

Tip 3) Use other shuttles as reference, if you find your stuck on something check out how another ship handles your problem.

Tip 4) Control + Z is undo, pretty much this.
